    <h2>Hey, I'm Oshadha Gunasekara! 👋</h2>

    <p>
        I'm currently a software development engineer at <code>Amazon</code> based in Seattle, Washington. I graduated in May 2020 from <code>Carnegie Mellon University</code> with a Bachelors in Electrical & Computer Engineering and an additional major in Robotics.
        I have <code>~ 6 years</code> of professional software engineering experience, having worked at <code>Epic Systems</code>, <code>Indeed</code>, and <code>Amazon</code> as full-stack software engineers.
        Though this professional experience is primarily in the web-development space, I have done extensive robotics software work during internships at <code>Carnegie Mellon University</code> and <code>University of Arizona</code> as well as a number of side projects apart from those.
        <br/><br/>
        I am comfortable developing software in a wide variety of languages, including but not limited to <code>python</code>, <code>c++</code>, <code>java</code>, <code>c#</code>, <code>html/css</code>, and <code>typescript/javascript</code>. I love learning new things and continue to expand list as I progress through my career.
        <br/><br/>
        Please feel free to check out more of my projects and resume in the other pages of this website!
