    <h2>Howdy, I'm Oshadha Gunasekara! ðŸ‘‹</h2>

    <p>
        I'm a full-stack software engineer currently based in Phoenix, Arizona. I graduated in May 2020 from <code>Carnegie Mellon University</code> with a Bachelors in Electrical & Computer Engineering and an additional major in Robotics.
        I have <code>2.5 years</code> of professional software engineering experience, having worked at <code>Epic Systems</code> and <code>Indeed</code> as full-stack software engineers.
        Though this professional experience is primarily in the web-development space, I have done extensive robotics software work during internships at <code>Carnegie Mellon University</code> and <code>University of Arizona</code> as well as a number of side projects in between.
        <br/><br/>
        I am comfortable developing software in a wide variety of languages/technologies, including but not limited to <code>python</code>, <code>c++</code>, <code>java</code>, <code>c#</code>, <code>html/css</code>, and <code>typescript/javascript</code>.
        <br/><br/>
        Unfortunately, I was affected by the March 2023 layoffs at Indeed, so I've decided to spend this time exploring an area of engineering that I am working hard to pivot into - Robotics.
        After skilling up, I would love to work as a robotics software engineer in the future.
        <br/><br/>
        Currently, I am finishing up Udacity's <a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/robotics-software-engineer--nd209">Robotics Software Engineer Nanodegree</a>, a fantastic course that provides a practical understanding of mobile robot mapping, localization, and path planning algorithms.
        In this course, I designed a simulated robot and environment and utilized ROS packages such as <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros">RTAB-Map</a>, <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/amcl">AMCL</a>, <a href="http://wiki.ros.org/move_base">move-base</a> to map a simulated environment, localize within that environment, and move the robot to specific goal positions.
        <br/><br/>
