ðŸ‘‹ Hello! Iâ€™m Oshadha Gunasekara, a full-stack software engineer. In my former role at Indeed, I worked on backend services to help Enterprise customers more effectively match and source applicants for their job openings.

Ever since high school, Iâ€™ve been interested in making and learning how the world works around us. That led me to discover the vast and interesting world of Engineering. From there on, Iâ€™ve come to learn how to design and build my own devices that do what I want them to do. Through these projects, Iâ€™ve learned how to design with SolidWorks, program in various languages, create electrical schematics, analyze systems, and so much more. I love what Iâ€™ve learned so far and want to continue learning more and doing more.
