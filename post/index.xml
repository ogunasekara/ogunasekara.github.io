      <description>&lt;p&gt;Unique to Carnegie Mellon University, buggy is a competition where Greek and independent organizations race with their buggies, small, low, aerodynamic vehicles, powered only by gravity and human pushers. Traditionally, students are recruited to drive these on the course. In the Atlas Project, our goal to make a buggy that can drive itself around the course using only the limited knowledge we can get from our sensors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;HSA is a personal project of mine, sprung up initially through the boredom of not having anything to do while at home for winter break. The goal was to make a two wheel differential drive robot using only off the shelf components that could be controlled and visualized remotely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
