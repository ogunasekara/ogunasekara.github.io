RoboDutchman is a robotics project developed for 24-778 (Mechatronic Design). Each year, Leidos challenges CMU students in 24-778 to create an autonomous robot to assist with maintenance on different components on the ship, including reading/updating the state of valves and breakers and navigating autonomously in a fixed environment.

As a result, we made the decision to use a fixed mobile robot base with a 4 DOF robot arm. In order to manipulate the breakers and valves
