<p>I’m Oshadha Gunasekara, a software developer at Epic Systems. In my role, I work on the transition of Epic’s software from its previous technology stack (utilizing ASP.NET) to more modern web technologies.</p>

<p>Ever since high school, I’ve been interested in making and learning how the world works around us. That led me to discover the vast and interesting world of Engineering. From there on, I’ve come to learn how to design and build my own devices that do what I want them to do. Through these projects, I’ve learned how to design with SolidWorks, program in various languages, create electrical schematics, analyze systems, and so much more. I love what I’ve learned so far and want to continue learning more and doing more.</p>

<p>Thanks for visiting my site! I’ll be continuing to update this website with projects in years to come. If you’re interested in getting in contact with me, I prefer email or Facebook messages.</p>
