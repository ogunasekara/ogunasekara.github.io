# Portfolio Website

This is my personal portfolio website. It is built using Jekyll (Ruby) and was initially based off of rosario's [Kasper](https://github.com/rosario/kasper.git) Jekyll theme. Since then, it has gone through a number of changes. It's current state utilizes the [tacit](https://github.com/yegor256/tacit) CSS framework. The website is hosted directly on GitHub utilizing GitHub Pages - an action automatically deploys on every merge to main.
